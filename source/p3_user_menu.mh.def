This file is used to define a menu on MSC/PATRAN's top menubar.  This file should be
located in either the user's home directory or the "shareware installation" directory.
The order in which this file is searched for is:

~/p3_user_menu.def
If this file does not exist:
$P3_HOME/shareware/msc/unsupported/utilities/p3_user_menu.def
($P3_HOME is usually /patran/patran3)

NOTES:
o The functions referenced by this file are a subset of the functions generally located
  in, $P3_HOME/shareware/msc/unsupported/utilities/plb/shareware.plb
o By default, the shareware menu is ghosted when P3/PATRAN is started. As soon as a
  database is opened, the shareware menu is highlighted and can be used and after
  closing the database again, the shareware menu is ghosted.
  If you want to use your own user_db_.. routines, it is recommended to set the keyword
  *ALWAYS ENABLED to TRUE. (see ca. 10 lines below).
